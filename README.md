## Retweet Analysis


## Introduction
This project will involve picking tweets in any topic (like sports, entertainment etc.) and retweet it so as to get maximum influence score (likes+comments+retweets). In this project I have created an algorithm that can learn from publicly available data and assign a score to any tweet based on its content and attributes. 

## Project Details
In this project I have used datasets from twitter using twitter api. We have used 25 trending hashtags. We have used XGBOOST regrression algorithm to achived optimal output.
